# Koii Improvement Proposals (KIP)

Koii is decentralized, this is the suggestion box.

Post an Issue in this repo to recommend a change to the Koii Network, and the foundation will discuss it at the next board meeting and allocate grants funding. 

Once grants have been allocated, they will appear below.

# Grants 
Koii Grants are payable in KOII, the [native token](https://docs.koii.network/earning-koii/network-economics) of the network, and can be distributed in milestones as components of the project are completed. 

Some components of Koii are not yet open source, but we will release them [here](https://github.com/koii-network/) and notify the community on [discord](https://discord.gg/koii), our [newsletter](https://www.koii.network/#email-b31f31bd-fffc-4ddb-84ff-f2448a776773) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/koiinetwork) as they are released. If you're missing some of the pieces, and can't find the answer to your question on the docs, [we're happy to help](https://discord.gg/koii).
